Scratch that it will take a few days to fix the wm,
It will  actually take one or two weeks,
Most likely when the server is out of credit,

wm is on my git hub repository now

    <strong>How admin is granted</strong>

 <p> <font size=4> We take admin very seriously, in order to be admin you need to know the rules and have a good work ethic, only Fiery admins others, if you show maturity, respect for the rules, and show an interest for the server. You will get admin faster by doing volunteer work. You will take a test on the rules before you are promoted<hr> <font size=5> <b>NEWS</b><p> <font size=4> Nothing much <p> <p> <p><hr>

<center> <font size=6> <b>Rules and Regulations</b><p> <font size=3><font face=arial >
<hr>

1. <b>Do not build in spawn limits</b>, Spawn limits as in the skys above spawn are completely off limits for building, we ensure the skys are clear to give spawn a cleaner look, if you want to build go far left or right of spawn till  you get to the first beach, then go in the sky and build on a sky island <p>
2.<b>Respect authority, </b>our admins work hard to keep the server under control and work hard around the server to make it bigger and give it a cleaner look, they know the rules, if they tell you to do something you must respect what they ask of you, they know what there doing <p>
3.<b>Do not lag spawn, </b>dont we all hate it when we lag, we cant either anything done, set asside chat, so please do not lag the server so we can all enjoy the game.<p>
4.<b>You may not use water in your builds unless you have special authority</b>, building in the sky with water is strictly prohibited, this rule is enforced because when a house is grieved for whatever reason the water falls out and makes a giant mess on the ground, if over a city its very hard to clean<p>

5. <b>Do not steal or grieve, </b>Stealing and grieving is prohibited, users have spent there time to build their creations; it is not allowed to destroy their creations let alone steal their items. You must not steal seeing items of value required tc to be built, watching videos for tc really bores most of us so do not steal.<p>
<Center><br><div style="margin: 2px;"> 
6. <b>No cursing</b>, Blockheads is a game for many ages rangeing from 8-18 years of age, (some even adults!) Users ages 8-12 may not need to learn those words, so don’t say them. This is a good lesson in life aswell, never swear and people WILL respect you more, its a fact.<p>
7.<b>Dating is allowed but do not take it too far, </b>this rule is quite simular to cursing, there are children that play this game that arent ready for that kind of stuff, just because you’ve matured doesnt mean they have, dating can be fun, but this game is ultimately not a dating site, let alone my server so keep it minor.And “sex” is in no way allowed <p>
<hr> <font size=5> <center> Admin rules<p><font size=4>
1.<b>Follow the server rules</b>, follow the server rules because they still apply to you, being admin doesn’t give you immunity<p>
2. <b>Do not admin people</b>, you may mod people but they must have a clear understanding of the rules,<p>
3. <b>All admins must make a builders club tryout</b>, this is enforced to build the server as fast as possible, comments such as “i suck at building” etc is not tolerated.<p>
4. <b>Be slow to ban, </b>many rules are in place but banning others from the server is quite extreme and aggressive, kick only, however in extreme cases banning is appropriate.<p>
5.<b>You can only build in the sky like other players</b>to add on to spawn you gotta get into builders club, and even then you need permission.<p>
6.<b> Admins must follow admin policy </b> if any admin violates the admin policy it may result in demotion or ban. (See admin policy).
<p><hr><fontsize=5> <b>Hierarchy</b><fontsize=3> The Hierarchy is the rank of administers in the server. <p> Co-owner: ••nora•• <p> Head admin:N/A <p> <font size=4> <b>Probation</b> <font-size=3> If any admin does not do work assigned after agreeing to do so, they will be put on probation. When you’re on probation you’re on the brink of demotion, you must do the work you were assigned at a different time AND you will have to do more work as punishment for not doing the initial work on time. If you do not do the work on time while on probation you will be demoted to a normal, you will not be mod.

Builders Team is a team of users that build up the server, if you are good at building fiery would love you on the builders team, <p> However, you must make a tryout in order to enter builders team. This tryout must consist, and consist only of: steel, compost, lime trees, steel uplights/downlights, and gray paint for the compost,(Compost is NOT the building block, its for the lime trees)this is the same style spawn is made of. <p>When you complete your tryout ask fiery to review your tryout, at worst you will have to try again.

This server was originally created back in July, 2017 named “Infinity 2”. From there the spawn got bigger and bigger, and the island the spawn was built on was longer on the right side than the left by twice the size. This was, according to fiery an annoyance. Eventually the island spawn was on was dug up quite a bit, and buildings were made on the left side according to the present style. However, the spawn was not made symmetrical until months later after a server failure. The server faced an activity low resulting in the server being abandoned. Months later,  Fiery reopened the server, and our royal admin and co owner, Brooklyn quinn, or as you know her now as Nora_light. Being a previous admin in the server, she was here when the server was created, moreover she rejoined when Fiery reactivated the server and together Fiery and Nora brought the server back to activity. The spawn made massive progress, as we had many builders to help build spawn up. Fiery made the spawn symmetrical himself and made the left side beach, then instructed admins to build the right side of the beach. Then panix pete joined. little did we know he was a great builder. He built a whole city right of spawn known as exodus, then delta city was made along with the whole railroad system. Then the server faced another severe crash and failed AGAIN. This time it was out for a long while spending 4 months inactive. Eventually, just back in September, Fiery got some people rallied up and got someone to fund the server (Demon Eli). He added a week, then a month when he saw the server. We got right to work building cities and allied two server, Eternity, and alis islands. Fiery ticked some people off there through his leadership position. The malicious admins there were not too great, and plotted to damage spawn. At first one person tryed to damage spawn but then someone from that server told us everyone behind it, (some close friends!) and many admins were demoted for having relations to that server, as there was a possibility that they were apart of the plot. Then Fiery got in contact with the server owner of Ali islands, as she was gone when all of this unraveled. We ended the nonsense at once, and things began to cool down. Then spawn was damaged again by a rogue admin and other admins from her server. They didn't do as much damage as the plot, but they did an irritating amount. Using the logs fiery determined who did it and banned all the IPs Involved. Now we have a server with great staff, and the server has been fairly active. </div>
