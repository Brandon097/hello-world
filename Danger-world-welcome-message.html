Stalin.<br><br>

Ill report this to the discord. I added this to the admin chat instead of deleting it and took the part out about deleting it after reading it. By the way, sorry if Im late... (look at message below)Also, message in the admin chat next time :)<br>~::::Rose::: <br><font size="1"><font color="white"> <font size="7">~~~<br><font size="3"><font color="#b19cd9"><br> Sorry I havent been on lately, I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet ..... luckily my phone was a cheap, special edition phone. So, my phone didnt have any moisture sensors to sense the water damage... so the people at the Apple store didnt see any water damage so I got it replaced (damage resorts in replacement unless theres liquid damage sensed by the moisture detectors)I didnt get it replaced for like a week though because if they saw water damage they could immediately just take my phone . Anyways I got it replaced on Sunday , and now I can play! Also, theres like nobody online during the daytime (of my time zone)so the chances of me being online while you (anyone reading this) is slim. Sorry for the inconvenience!<br>~::::Rose:::
