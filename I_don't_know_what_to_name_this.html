  <p>I don’t know if I’m mad or frustrated, I always loved you and i definitely wish to be with you, to see and be my life, to be my wife.</p>

   <p>But when ken disrespecting me and saying false things about me:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>accusing me of hitting on other girls</li>
    <li>him telling your mother that i was touching all over you,</li>
    <li>him saying in front of everyone in anime club that i was talking to a girl with no choice while i was facetimeing you</li>
    <li>lying about my dick size.</li>
   </ol>

   <p>The fact from my freshman year to my junior year of having to sit hear ya making out at the end of the day,
   almost everyday,
   <span class="red">I lost my romantic</span>, and I known I wouldn’t be able to get you back regardless if you say I’m your boyfriend or not because you usually talk about him as your boyfriend.</p>

   <p>But I never gave up.</p>

   <p>Then <span class="red">he fucks with my sister and transferred. Telling her about me waiting for you at the lockers and when I accidentally went to your lunch, the conversation</span>.</p>

   <p>My sister say he wasn’t trying to hit on her only because he said if i doesn’t mess with him he won’t mess with me.</p>

   <p>I should’ve gotten up and pushed him away from my sister, I should’ve done something</p>

   <p>somewhat at this point i rather not say to many things here</p>

   <p>on December 10, 2019, i was looking on Reddit just scrolling across relationship_advice until i went onto a other subreddit and saw <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/e4quxi/advice_please_stop_confessing_to_your_crushes_ask/">this post</a>.</p>

   <p>And so rather then telling about my feelings of which I’m terrible at doing because of what i lost earlier.</p>

   <p>I planned on asking you out after fourth period.</p>

   <p>
     <strong>That was until you said someone asked you to prom and you accepted it,</strong>
   I just then accepted i had badluck and either got mad or frustrated, here i would be saying the samething i said at the start of this page</p>

   <p>At this point while typing I don’t know what to type anymore, i was just mad that i had to deal with ken, then this and that, or I don’t know.</p>
   <p>I just want to love and care</p>
