  <p>I don’t know if I’m mad or frustrated, I always loved you and I definitely wish to be with you, to see and be in my life, to be my wife.</p>

  <p>But when Ken disrespecting me and saying false things about me:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Accusing me of hitting on other girls</li>
    <li>Him telling your mother that i was touching all over you</li>
    <li>Him saying in front of everyone in anime club that i was talking to a girl with no choice while i was facetimeing you</li>
    <li>lying about my dick size.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The fact from my freshman year to my junior year of having to sit hear him making out at the end of the day, almost everyday, <span class="red">I lost my romantic because of That</span>. It made me stop texting "hey boo".</p>

  <p>But I never gave up.</p>

  <p>Then <span class="red">he fucks with my sister and transferred. Telling her about me waiting for you at the lockers, and when I accidentally went to your lunch, the conversation</span>. I should’ve listened to what he was talking about to my sister.</p>

  <p>My sister say he wasn’t trying to hit on her only because he said if i doesn’t mess with him he won’t mess with me.</p>

  <p>I should’ve gotten up and pushed him away from my sister, I should’ve done something.</p>

  <p>Somewhat at this point i rather not say to many things here.</p>

  <p>On December 10, 2019, i was looking on Reddit just scrolling across relationship_advice until i went onto a other subreddit and saw <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/e4quxi/advice_please_stop_confessing_to_your_crushes_ask/">this post</a>.</p>

  <p>And so rather then telling about my feelings of which I’m terrible at doing because of what i lost earlier.</p>

  <p>I planned on asking you out after fourth period.</p>

  <p>
    <strong>That was until you said someone asked you to prom and you accepted it,</strong> I just then accepted i had badluck and either got mad or frustrated, here i would be saying the samething i said at the start of this page</p>

  <p><del>At this point while typing I don’t know what to type anymore, i was just mad that i had to deal with ken, then this and that, or I don’t know</del>.</p>
  <p>I wasn’t made because you were asked out to prom, it was because that it happened when i was going to ask out you as if bad things suddenly happen whenever i do something.</p>
  <p>I just want to love and care</p>
